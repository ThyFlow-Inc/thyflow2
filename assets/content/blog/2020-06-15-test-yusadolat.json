  "body": "\n\nYour appearance matters. You hear this point driven home repeatedly when it comes to women and their beauty, but with men, there is not a substantial amount of focus on it. Why? Men do care about how they look and they want to present themselves in the best way possible.\n\nThe desire to want and look good is not wrong. Self-care, strong self-image, and strengthened confidence is not evil.\n\nWe at Thyflow are on a mission to grow the men’s grooming industry. We understand that men want to feel their best and a haircut and slick grooming is a big part of that.\n\n#### The Importance of the First Impression\n\nMaking a great first impression, especially in the workplace, is the first step to climbing up the ladder of influence. First impressions deal with how one personality affects another. Your appearance has a lot to do with that.\n\nconsider your best first impression? What were you wearing? How were you feeling? Were you exuding confidence?\n\nNow consider your worst first impression? What opposites occurred in this scenario?\n\nIn your first impression, you were probably styling. You looked good thereby you felt good.\n\nFirst impressions are not something to shy away from. Here at ThyFlow, you can be sure that we will equip you with the most high-quality haircut and grooming services so that you can walk into your work week as total boss!\n\n\n\n#### Appearance in the Workplace\n\nHaving a strong haircut plays a big role in looking your best at your occupation. Whether you are going in for a first interview or you simply want to impress your colleagues, a good haircut will help you gain respect within your workplace.\n\nGroom. Dress to impress. Follow the company rules. Remember these three things and you will be sure to knock it out of the park.\n\nYou do not want to arrive at work looking like you have just rolled out of bed. That’s a huge no-no. Assure you wake up in the morning with sufficient time to dress nicely and fix your hair. A well-done haircut will help not hinder you.\n\nPut thought into what you’re wearing. Start from the top (your hair) and work your way down. If you have to, layout your garment the night before that way you do not have to stress in the morning.\n\n\n\nAlways remember to follow the company policy, especially when it comes to hair. Most companies require clean cut hair that does not go over the ears. With ThyFlow, you can tell your stylist exactly what you want (or what your company requires) and they will deliver.\n\nHaircuts are a huge part of looking and feeling your best. Don’t take them for granted because you think you don’t have time to get it done. Contact us at ThyFlow and we will be more than happy to help you out.\n\n\n\n*Subscribe to our blog to stay up to date on all of the latest ThyFlow updates, news, and opportunities.
