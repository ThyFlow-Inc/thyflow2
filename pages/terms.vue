                  ThyFlow reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to
                  terminate your access to the Site and the related services or
                  any portion thereof at any time, without notice. To the
                  maximum extent permitted by law, this agreement is governed by
                  the laws of the State of California and you hereby consent to
                  the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of courts in California
                  in all disputes arising out of or relating to the use of the
                  Site. Use of the Site is unauthorized in any jurisdiction that
                  does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms,
                  including, without limitation, this section.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or
                  agency relationship exists between you and ThyFlow as a result
                  of this agreement or use of the Site. ThyFlow's performance of
                  this agreement is subject to existing laws and legal process,
                  and nothing contained in this agreement is in derogation of
                  ThyFlow's right to comply with governmental, court and law
                  enforcement requests or requirements relating to your use of
                  the Site or information provided to or gathered by ThyFlow
                  with respect to such use. If any part of this agreement is
                  determined to be invalid or unenforceable pursuant to
                  applicable law including, but not limited to, the warranty
                  disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, then
                  the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed
                  superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely
                  matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder
                  of the agreement shall continue in effect. Unless otherwise
                  specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire
                  agreement between the user and ThyFlow with respect to the
                  Site and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous
                  communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or
                  written, between the user and ThyFlow with respect to the
                  Site.

                  agreement to the same extent and subject to the same
                  conditions as other business documents and records originally
