                  Our guidelines were developed to help make every experience feel safe, respectful, and positive. They apply to everyone who uses any of our apps, including barbers, customers, and Master Barbers. We appreciate you for joining us to support and safeguard a welcoming environment for everyone.

The guidelines below help explain some of the specific kinds of behavior that may cause you to lose access to the ThyFlow app and website. There will always be unforeseen events that may ultimately lead to you losing access to ThyFlow app and we’ll update these guidelines regularly but the following guidelines are sufficient cause for ThyFlow to take action. Please take a moment to read them.

                  Guideline for All
                </div>

                <p>
                Everyone who signs up for a ThyFlow account is required to follow ThyFlow’s  Community Guidelines. They reflect the following pillars and the standards in each of these sections.
Treat everyone with respect at all times.

Our community is remarkably diverse and, chances are, you will encounter people who might not look like you or share your beliefs. The guidelines in this section help to foster positive interactions during every experience and help keep one another safe.

We are hard at work every day to help create safer experiences for everyone. Your safety drives us. That is why these standards were written. We are committed to following all applicable laws and earning your trust, and we expect everyone who uses our apps to do their part and adhere to applicable laws and regulations, as well as privacy rules and regulations where applicable.

                If something happens, whether it is good or bad, we make it easy for you to tell us. Our team is continuously improving our standards, and your feedback is important to keep our standards relevant as our technology evolves.

                  Treat Everyone with Respect
                </div>

                <p>
                 Treat your fellow ThyFlow app users as you would like to be treated yourself: with respect. The actions you take while using the ThyFlow apps can have a big impact on the safety and comfort of others. Courtesy matters. That’s why you are expected to exercise good judgment and behave decently towards other people when using ThyFlow apps—just as you would in any public place.

                  For example: Always try to be at home and ready for your appointment because nobody likes to wait. It is also a common courtesy to take care of your pets and by making sure there is a place for haircut to take place. Most importantly, remember that when you use ThyFlow apps you will meet people who may look differently or think differently than you. Please respect those differences. We believe that everyone should feel supported and welcomed when they use ThyFlow apps. That’s why we’ve created standards on physical contact, sexual assault and misconduct, rude behavior, unwanted contact, and discrimination.

                  Physical Contact
                </div>
                <p>
                Don’t touch strangers or anyone you just met while using any of  ThyFlow Apps, Hitting, hurting, or otherwise intending to hurt anyone is never allowed.

                Sexual Assault and Misconduct
                </div>
                <p>
                We all value our personal space and privacy. It is okay to chat with other people. But please do not comment on someone’s appearance or ask whether they are single. Sexual assault and sexual misconduct of any kind is prohibited. Sexual assault and misconduct refers to sexual contact or behavior without explicit consent of the other person.

Personal space and privacy should be respected. The following list provides examples of inappropriate conduct.

    Behaviors and comments that could make people feel uncomfortable are not acceptable. Examples include nudges, whistles, and winks. Do not touch or flirt with people you do not know.

    Certain conversations that could be perceived as harmless can be offensive. Do not comment on appearance, perceived gender identity, or sexual orientation. Refrain from asking unrelated personal questions, such as “Are you in a relationship?” Avoid discussing your own or someone else’s sex life, using explicit language, or making jokes about sex.

    ThyFlow has a no-sex rule. Sexual contact is prohibited while using ThyFlow apps, including at home haircut appointments, regardless of whether you know the person or they give you their consent. This includes activities such as sexual intercourse, solicitation of sexual intercourse, masturbation, or touching and exposure of sexual body parts.

                  Threatening and Rude Behavior
                </div>
                <p>
                 Aggressive, confrontational, and harassing behavior is not allowed. Do not use language or make gestures that could be disrespectful, threatening, or inappropriate. It may be a good idea to stay away from personal topics that can potentially be divisive, like religion and political beliefs.
                </p>

Unwanted Contact
                </div>
                <p>
                 Contact should end when the appointment is complete, unless it’s to return a lost item. For example, texting, calling, visiting, or trying to visit someone in person after an appointment has been completed is not allowed.
                </p>

                  The Service is controlled, operated and administered by
                  ThyFlow from our offices within the USA. If you access the
                  Service from a location outside the USA, you are responsible
                  for compliance with all local laws. You agree that you will
                  not use the ThyFlow Content accessed through www.Thyflow.com
                  in any country or in any manner prohibited by any applicable
                  laws, restrictions or regulations.

                <div class="mb-4 text-2xl font-bold">Discrimination</div>
                <p>
                  You should always feel safe and welcome. That’s why we don’t tolerate conduct we’ve determined to be discriminatory. Do not discriminate against someone based on traits such as their age, color, disability, gender identity, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law.

For example, it is unacceptable to refuse to provide services based on characteristics like a person’s age, color, disability, gender identity, marital status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or any other characteristic protected under relevant law. It is also unacceptable to rate another user—whether they’re a customer, service provider, team member, based on these above traits.

In addition, it is not acceptable to discriminate on the basis of a customers house or a customer’s haircut location (Friends house). We understand how important it is to fit a mobile haircut appointment around your life, rather than the other way around. It is not a violation of these guidelines to pass on an appointment because it does not work for you. But intentionally refusing or canceling requests, or using features in ThyFlow apps to avoid receiving appointment request, solely for the purpose of avoiding a particular neighborhood due to the characteristics of the people or businesses that are located in that area is not allowed.

You can learn more about ThyFlow’s non-discrimination policy here.

We also want to help increase the mobile service industry options for locals with disabilities. That’s why we have information available for customers, Service providers on this topic. You can go here to learn more about ThyFlow commitment to accessibility. Service providers using ThyFlow apps must comply with all relevant laws governing the transportation of motor vehicle.
