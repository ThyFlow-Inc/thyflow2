                <p>
                  In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute
                  between them arising out of or concerning these Terms and
                  Conditions, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract,
                  tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any
                  other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by
                  final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal
                  Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and
                  administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a
                  similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a
                  location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's
                  award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in
                  any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or
                  equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or
                  concerns these Terms and Conditions, the prevailing party
                  shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable
                  attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes
                  and claims in regards to these Terms and Conditions or any
                  disputes arising as a result of these Terms and Conditions,
                  whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are
                  a result of these Terms and Conditions. The parties agree that
                  the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and
                  enforcement of this provision. The entire dispute, including
                  the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision
                  shall be determined by the Arbitrator. This arbitration
                  provision shall survive the termination of these Terms and
                  Conditions.

                  Any arbitration under these Terms and Conditions will take
                  place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and
                  class/representative/collective actions are not permitted. The
                  parties agree that a party may bring claims against the other
                  only in each's individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or
                  class member in any putative class, collective and/ or
                  representative proceeding, such as in the form of a private
                  attorney general action against the other. Further, unless
                  both you and ThyFlow agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not
                  consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not
                  otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class
                  proceeding.
